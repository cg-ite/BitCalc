# BitCalc

BitCalc is a small program that I needed when I implemented a Lanc remote control 
on an Arduino. Lanc is a protocol from Sony whose bits are inverted. For more 
technical details see here http://www.boehmel.de/lanc. 

For this reason I needed a tool which can invert and reverse 
the transmitted bits and
calculate the corresponding dec and hex value of the byte.

As a small tool don't exspect too much. 

I hope that the program is quite self-explanatory. Mabye somebody finds it useful.
